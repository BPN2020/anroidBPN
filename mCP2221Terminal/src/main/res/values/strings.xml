          (including reasonable attorney\'s fees), liabilities, and losses, including without 
          limitation: (x) any claims directly or indirectly arising from or related to the use, 
          modification, disclosure or distribution of the Application, content, or any Intellectual 
          Property Rights related thereto; (y) the use, sale and distribution of Licensee Products; 
          and (z) breach of this License.  \n\n
          
          8.<b><u>Confidentiality.</u></b> Licensee agrees that the Application (including but not 
         limited to the source code, object code and library files) and its modifications or 
         derivatives, Documentation, content and underlying inventions, algorithms, know-how and 
         ideas relating to the Application and the content are proprietary information belonging 
         to Microchip and its licensors (\"Proprietary Information\").  Except as expressly and 
         unambiguously allowed herein, Licensee will hold in confidence and not use or disclose 
         any Proprietary Information and will similarly bind its employees, in writing.  
         Proprietary Information will not include information that: (i) is in or enters the public 
         domain without breach of this License and through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) the 
         receiving party was legally in possession of prior to receiving it; (iii) the receiving party
          can demonstrate was developed by the receiving party independently and without use of or 
          reference to the disclosing party\'s Proprietary Information; or (iv) the receiving party 
          receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure.  If Licensee is required to 
          disclose Proprietary Information by law, court order, or government agency, License will 
          give Microchip prompt notice of such requirement in order to allow Microchip to object or 
          limit such disclosure.  Licensee agrees that the provisions of this License regarding 
          unauthorized use and nondisclosure of the Application, Documentation, content and related 
          Proprietary Rights are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Microchip 
          and its licensors and that monetary damage alone cannot adequately compensate Microchip or
          its licensors if such provisions are violated.  Licensee, therefore, agrees that if 
          Microchip alleges that Licensee has breached or violated such provision then Microchip 
          will have the right to injunctive relief, without the requirement for the posting of a bond, 
          in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity.\n\n
         
         9.<b><u>Ownership of Proprietary Rights.</u></b> You acknowledge that (a) the Application 
         contains proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual 
         property and other laws, and (b) Microchip and/or third parties own and retain all right, 
         title and interest in and to the Application and content, excluding content provided by you,
         that may be presented or accessed through the Application, including without limitation all 
         Intellectual Property Rights therein and thereto. You agree that you will not, and will not 
         allow any third party to, (i) copy, sell, license, distribute, transfer, modify, adapt, 
         translate, prepare derivative works from, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or 
         otherwise attempt to derive Source Code from the Application or content that may be 
         presented or accessed through the Application for any purpose, unless otherwise permitted, 
         (ii) take any action to circumvent or defeat the security or content usage rules provided, 
         deployed or enforced by any functionality (including without limitation digital rights 
         management functionality) contained in the Application, (iii) use the Application to access,
         copy, transfer, transcode or retransmit content in violation of any law or third party 
         rights, or (iv) remove, obscure, or alter Microchip’s or any third party’s copyright notices,
         trademarks, or other proprietary rights notices affixed to or contained within or accessed 
         in conjunction with or through the Application.  \n\n
         
         10.<b><u>Termination of License.</u></b> Without prejudice to any other rights, this License 
         terminates immediately, without notice by Microchip, upon a failure by Licensee to comply 
         with any provision of this License.  Upon termination, Licensee will immediately stop using 
         the Application, Documentation, content, modifications and derivatives thereof, and immediately 
         destroy all such copies.\n\n
         
         11.<b><u>Indemnity.</u></b> To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, 
         indemnify and hold harmless Microchip, its affiliates and their respective directors, 
         officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or 
         proceedings, as well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses 
         (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising out of or accruing from your use of the 
         Application, including your downloading, installation, or use of the Application, or your 
         violation of these Terms and Conditions.\n\n
         
         12.<b><u>Warranty Disclaimers.</u></b> THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITHOUT 
         WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY 
         OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  MICROCHIP 
         AND ITS LICENSORS ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY, PURPOSE OR RELIABILITY OF THE 
         APPLICATION OR DOCUMENTATION.  MICROCHIP AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE 
         APPLICATION WILL MEET REQUIREMENTS OF LICENSEE OR THIRD PARTY, BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.  
         MICROCHIP AND ITS LICENSORS HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO CORRECT ANY DEFECTS IN THE APPLICATION.  
         THE APPLICATION IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN THE OPERATION LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS, EMERGENCY 
         COMMUNICATIONS, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEMS, 
         OR ANY OTHER ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE APPLICATION COULD LEAD TO DEATH, 
         PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.\n\n
         
         13.<b><u>Limited Liability.</u></b> IN NO EVENT WILL MICROCHIP OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE 
         OR OBLIGATED UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR 
         EXPENSES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR 
         CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, 
         TECHNOLOGY, SERVICES, OR ANY CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY 
         DEFENSE THEREOF), OR OTHER SIMILAR COSTS.  The aggregate and cumulative liability of 
         Microchip and its licensors for damages hereunder will in no event exceed the amount 
         Licensee paid Microchip for the Application and Documentation.  Licensee acknowledges that 
         the foregoing limitations are reasonable and an essential part of this License.\n\n
         
         14.<b><u>General.</u></b> THIS LICENSE WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED UNDER THE LAWS OF 
         THE STATE OF ARIZONA AND THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PROVISIONS.  
         Licensee agrees that any disputes arising out of or related to this License, the 
         Application or Documentation will be brought exclusively in either the U.S. District Court 
         for the District of Arizona, Phoenix Division, or the Superior Court of Arizona located in 
         Maricopa County, Arizona.  This License will constitute the entire agreement between the 
         parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  It will not be modified except by a 
         written agreement signed by an authorized representative of Microchip.  If any provision of 
         this License will be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or 
         unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary 
         so that this License will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  No 
         waiver of any breach of any provision of this License will constitute a waiver of any prior, 
         concurrent or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver 
         will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the 
         waiving party.  Licensee agrees to comply with all import and export laws and restrictions 
         and regulations of the Department of Commerce or other United States or foreign agency or 
         authority. The indemnities, obligations of confidentiality, and limitations on liability 
         described herein, and any right of action for breach of this License prior to termination, 
         will survive any termination of this License. Any prohibited assignment will be null and
